# Hey, I’m Niranjan Liyanage 👋

Welcome to my corner of the web! This is where I share personal reflections, tech experiments, and thoughts that don’t always fit into the more polished, professional side of my portfolio. 

Think of this space as my **open diary + playground** for ideas. For my professional work, please visit [portfolio](https://shanz007.github.io/).

My journey into technology began with a gentle push from my father. Right after finishing school, he encouraged me to pursue a Bachelor’s in IT as my first step into higher education. I owe him so much for planting that seed, it was his belief that set me on this path.

Since then, I’ve never let go of my passion for learning and shaping my career around software and information technology. Over the years, my curiosity has only grown stronger, taking me through many roles — from junior, senior to tech lead and as researcher and across different tech industries and countries, without borders.

## Beyond Code

When I'm not working, I enjoy traveling, photography, and exploring different cultures and perspectives.
